Jul 12 13:15:06 <hunterb>   IDs are stupid
Jul 12 13:15:08 *   copygirl (~copygirl@p54A42891.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined
Jul 12 13:15:11 <hunterb>   naming is better
Jul 12 13:15:25 <hunterb>   dickSlapper from dickSlapMod
Jul 12 13:15:39 <hunterb>   I mean, who's gonna have the same thing
Jul 12 13:15:42 <hunterb>   from the same mod
Jul 12 13:15:58 <copygirl>  a guy named dickSlapper
Jul 12 13:16:08 <hunterb>   ah
Jul 12 13:16:39 <NoahBeech> Jeez I've been stuck at a logic issue forever now
Jul 12 13:16:55 *   Archemide has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jul 12 13:16:58 <NoahBeech> only one attribute modifier at a time, but removing one removes them all
Jul 12 13:17:10 <ft975> hunterb: Do you have a better way to store large amounts of data? IDs take up 12 bits, names take up 24*number of characters bits
Jul 12 13:17:11 <hunterb>   keep a list of ones
Jul 12 13:17:27 *   iPixeli (iPixeli@us.freeBNC.net) has joined
Jul 12 13:17:28 <NoahBeech> hunter doesn't work like that
Jul 12 13:17:28 *   MineBot gives voice to iPixeli
Jul 12 13:17:29 <hunterb>   you and your bits
Jul 12 13:17:35 <hunterb>   keep a list of current ones
Jul 12 13:17:39 <hunterb>   and when you need to remove one
Jul 12 13:17:43 <hunterb>   remove them all
Jul 12 13:17:47 <hunterb>   and apply the rest back
Jul 12 13:18:03 <ntzrmtthihu777>    fucking sweet :D
Jul 12 13:18:04 *   Wylker is now known as Wylker|work
Jul 12 13:18:10 <hunterb>   ft975: does it really matter how many bits you take up
Jul 12 13:18:14 <ft975> Yes
Jul 12 13:18:21 <hunterb>   why
Jul 12 13:18:22 *   SoundLogic (~SoundLogi@static-63-131-38-87.mil.onecommunications.net) has joined
Jul 12 13:18:23 <ft975> Ram and HD space is not unlimted
Jul 12 13:18:27 <hunterb>   -_-
Jul 12 13:18:36 <hunterb>   you're concerned about BITS
Jul 12 13:18:38 <ntzrmtthihu777>    or swap, for that matter :P
Jul 12 13:18:58 *   Fiery-Zzz is now known as Fiery-phone
Jul 12 13:19:08 <AbrarSyed> you know what i rally hate?
Jul 12 13:19:12 <hunterb>   me
Jul 12 13:19:16 <AbrarSyed> thinking something is working perfectly after testing
Jul 12 13:19:26 *   HanFox is now known as HanFox|gone
Jul 12 13:19:37 <AbrarSyed> and then finding out later that another task isnt workign ebcause what you that was working is actually broken
Jul 12 13:19:44 <AbrarSyed> and then having to go back and fix it...
Jul 12 13:19:52 <AbrarSyed> so freaking annoying....
Jul 12 13:19:52 <ntzrmtthihu777>    now, one question, this server world, it will remain the same each login?
Jul 12 13:19:53 <ft975> For a 200x200x200 world, names would take up approximately 1.4GB of space
Jul 12 13:20:18 <hunterb>   well how bout the mods write names
Jul 12 13:20:23 <hunterb>   and then the game converts the names to id
Jul 12 13:20:34 <AbrarSyed> now a real nice way of saving would be to use IDs, but then have an ID-> name map somewhere
Jul 12 13:20:39 <hunterb>   so the ids are handles by mc
Jul 12 13:20:48 <AbrarSyed> mhmm
Jul 12 13:21:14 <hunterb>   so the game keeps a list of names to ids itself
Jul 12 13:21:25 <hunterb>   and it syncs with other clients when they join the world
Jul 12 13:21:37 <hunterb>   each time a new block is added, it gets a larger id
Jul 12 13:21:58 <hunterb>   so that each world in itself has its own set of name to id map
Jul 12 13:22:02 <ft975> hunterb: That would work, and the game already does it, sort of. Forge saves all the IDs with the map so it can warn you not to ruin your world.
Jul 12 13:22:18 <hunterb>   not the server though :P
Jul 12 13:22:21 <AbrarSyed> well
Jul 12 13:22:34 <tehbeard>  hmm, can you access that from the api ft?
Jul 12 13:22:34 <AbrarSyed> I was thinking to use that in a type of schematic format
Jul 12 13:22:45 <AbrarSyed> so it can be used cross-game without the exact same configuration
Jul 12 13:22:56 <AbrarSyed> blocks will have IDs specific to the schematic file
Jul 12 13:23:01 <tehbeard>  abrar, you said exactly the problem i'm currently working on
Jul 12 13:23:02 *   fuj1n has quit (Ping timeout: 194 seconds)
Jul 12 13:23:10 <hunterb>   :P
Jul 12 13:23:10 <ft975> tehbeard:  I'm not sure, I've only seen the system from the user's side, not the code
Jul 12 13:23:18 <AbrarSyed> and then the game will read that matching the name and convert IDs
Jul 12 13:23:31 *   AbrarSyed highfives tehbeard 
Jul 12 13:23:52 *   Archemide (~Archemide@67.41.75.62) has joined
Jul 12 13:24:00 <w00tc0d3>  how can I use the forge server installer for 1.5.2?
Jul 12 13:24:10 <hunterb>   ids just don't work on a large scale like mc
Jul 12 13:24:20 <hunterb>   because it gets complicated wiht conflicts
Jul 12 13:25:22 <AbrarSyed> hunterb, if you know anything about efficiency, saving a string for every location instead of a number will cause infinite lag
Jul 12 13:25:40 <hunterb>   yes but having to manually set each id is a terrible idea
Jul 12 13:25:58 <hunterb>   so at least something that bridges the two
Jul 12 13:26:06 <hunterb>   write with names, run with ids
Jul 12 13:26:20 <AbrarSyed> well.. Minecraft wasnt made to be modded.
Jul 12 13:26:33 <Flenix>    Only just tuning in here so not exactly sure what you're talking about,
Jul 12 13:26:46 <Flenix>    but I've always thought Forge should implement some sort of way that ID's are set with the modID
Jul 12 13:26:46 <hunterb>   we're talking about ids having conflicts
Jul 12 13:26:52 <Flenix>    for example myAwesomeMod.4
Jul 12 13:26:59 <AbrarSyed> npe, won't work.
Jul 12 13:27:02 <AbrarSyed> *won't
Jul 12 13:27:13 <AbrarSyed> it NEEDS to be an ID.. and 1.5 bytes is more than enough
Jul 12 13:27:13 <Archemide> you mean *nope?
Jul 12 13:27:28 *   lKinx (~lKinx@2602:304:cf60:c390:653c:f891:209e:3162) has joined
Jul 12 13:27:30 <AbrarSyed> yes, nope = nullpointerexception dontcha know?
Jul 12 13:27:34 <AbrarSyed> :P
Jul 12 13:27:37 <Flenix>    1.5 bytes; is that the 4096 ID limit?
Jul 12 13:27:38 <Archemide> :P
Jul 12 13:27:43 <AbrarSyed> Flenix,  yes.
Jul 12 13:27:46 <AbrarSyed> 256 = 1 byte
Jul 12 13:27:49 <Flenix>    I'd argue that's not enough at all personally, as someone who loves as much content as possible :P
Jul 12 13:27:54 <hunterb>   that doesn't sound like enough
Jul 12 13:27:59 <AbrarSyed> now think about it this way
Jul 12 13:28:07 <AbrarSyed> EVERY block in the world has to have an ID
Jul 12 13:28:11 <hunterb>   eww thinking
Jul 12 13:28:19 *   Renari (~Renari_@bngr-74-212-29-226-pppoe.dsl.bngr.epix.net) has joined
Jul 12 13:28:20 <AbrarSyed> so how many numbers is 1 17x16x256 chunk?
Jul 12 13:28:26 <AbrarSyed> *16x16x256
Jul 12 13:28:29 <Archemide> touche
Jul 12 13:28:32 <sci4me>    Hey guys, so.. you know how people build computers and things in redstone and they're ridiculously slow... well, could it be possible to make them a TON faster by making redstone faster? ive looked into the redstone code but im not really sure how it could be made faster...
Jul 12 13:28:41 <Flenix>    65536 :P
Jul 12 13:28:44 <AbrarSyed> if you had that manys trings.... minecraft would never laod or render anything
Jul 12 13:28:48 <AbrarSyed> *strings
Jul 12 13:28:51 <AbrarSyed> so it MUST be IDs
Jul 12 13:28:56 <Flenix>    Valid point
Jul 12 13:29:09 <AbrarSyed> and the limit of IDs, is directy related to the ammount of memory it needs to un
Jul 12 13:29:10 <Archemide> hmm. is there any way forge could up the cap?
Jul 12 13:29:18 <ft975>  I recently learned of Huffman Encoding, It might be useful in things like IDs, the size would be dependent on the number of blocks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
Jul 12 13:29:35 <AbrarSyed> 1.5 bytes is actually a really good amount because metadata in minecraft is exactly .5 bytes
Jul 12 13:29:39 <ft975> AbrarSyed: My calculations said 1.5GB as strings
Jul 12 13:29:43 <AbrarSyed> so 2bytes per block, and then whatever needs a TE
Jul 12 13:29:58 <AbrarSyed> lets say... 20 char strings
Jul 12 13:30:07 <ft975> assuming an 8 character average
Jul 12 13:30:13 <AbrarSyed> char = 2 bytes = 40 bytes per block
Jul 12 13:30:18 <AbrarSyed> who can fit a modid into 8 characters?
Jul 12 13:30:34 <hunterb>   don't facades stuff a crap ton of stuff into them?
Jul 12 13:30:41 <Archemide> aren't most modid's short?
Jul 12 13:30:44 <Flenix>    I bet all modders could change their ID's to 8 chars if thye wanted to
Jul 12 13:30:45 <AbrarSyed> facade = TileEntity
Jul 12 13:30:54 <AbrarSyed> now tile entities are different..
Jul 12 13:30:56 <Flenix>    My longest one is "FlenixCities", I could easily do flnxcity
Jul 12 13:31:02 <AbrarSyed> Flenix, thatd be a nightmare to fix conflicts with
Jul 12 13:31:24 <ft975> ftblock, ftdirt, ftlol, ftusles
Jul 12 13:31:30 <AbrarSyed> if we allow all unicode chars
Jul 12 13:31:43 <hunterb>   who wants to bug Mojang to do this next
Jul 12 13:31:52 *   AbrarSyed rolls eyes
Jul 12 13:31:53 <AbrarSyed> anyways
Jul 12 13:31:59 <AbrarSyed> it MUST BE INTEGER IDS
Jul 12 13:32:03 <sci4me>    ^^
Jul 12 13:32:05 <AbrarSyed> wel.. 1.5 byte ids
Jul 12 13:32:11 <Flenix>    Alright, what about a new form of meta. Forge looks at the IDs, and assigns it to a unique number set on the server/client (and editable in the config). Then, the ID's are loaded like ModID.BlockID (for example 3.564)
Jul 12 13:32:12 <AbrarSyed> integer = 4 bytes.. too much
Jul 12 13:32:18 <Flenix>    oh, no doubles?
Jul 12 13:32:21 <hunterb>   but the game can control the mapping of ids
Jul 12 13:32:24 <Flenix>    There goes my idea :P
Jul 12 13:32:29 <AbrarSyed> doubles are like 8 or something....
Jul 12 13:32:32 <ft975> Flenix: Doubles are 64 bits
Jul 12 13:32:37 <AbrarSyed> now what im thinking of is tis.
Jul 12 13:32:42 <hunterb>   shorts?
Jul 12 13:32:45 <AbrarSyed> I actually had cpw add this in to FML for me too
Jul 12 13:32:50 <AbrarSyed> there is the gameRegistry
Jul 12 13:32:52 <ft975> And they aren't fixed point
Jul 12 13:33:04 <ft975>  hunterb: Shorts are way too big
Jul 12 13:33:05 <AbrarSyed> which reisters every block, its ID, and its mod, as well as unlocalized name if you provide one
Jul 12 13:33:08 <hunterb>   bytes
Jul 12 13:33:17 <ft975> 2 bytes
Jul 12 13:33:21 <AbrarSyed> with thsi we effctively have a mod-name-id map to use
Jul 12 13:33:24 <ft975> 64: unsigned
Jul 12 13:33:42 <ft975> s/64:/64k
Jul 12 13:33:42 <OverbotDL1>    > ft975: 64k unsigned
Jul 12 13:34:19 <Flenix>    How would that map be useful though? :P
Jul 12 13:34:25 <AbrarSyed> when saving or loading a world, Minecraft would not lose any data due to different IDs because it can match by name from the file
Jul 12 13:34:34 <AbrarSyed> and then simply grab the ID for the name, and use that in the game
Jul 12 13:34:36 <hunterb>   didn't I mention that
Jul 12 13:34:50 <AbrarSyed> it would also fix IDconflicts, because Minecraft could just assign out IDs as blocks are registerred
Jul 12 13:35:01 <AbrarSyed> different ID configurations would be handled as I said above
Jul 12 13:35:07 <ft975> So who's going to make the pull request?
Jul 12 13:35:12 <hunterb>   hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:13 <hunterb>   so the game keeps a list of names to ids itself
Jul 12 13:35:14 <hunterb>   [1:21pm] <hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:16 <hunterb>   and it syncs with other clients when they join the world
Jul 12 13:35:17 <hunterb>   [1:21pm] <hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:18 <hunterb>   each time a new block is added, it gets a larger id
Jul 12 13:35:19 <hunterb>   [1:21pm] <hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:20 <hunterb>   so that each world in itself has its own set of name to id map
Jul 12 13:35:22 <AbrarSyed> right now, Minecraft MUST have the same IDs laod to load, otherwise you end up with transforming blocks and missing stuff
Jul 12 13:35:23 <Flenix>    That's a cool idea. But, I'm one of those guys that likes my stuff in creative in a certain order (or when sorting inventory with InvTweaks)
Jul 12 13:35:50 <AbrarSyed> yes hunter, you said that after I introduced the name-id map idea
Jul 12 13:35:53 <hunterb>   back to build.xmling

=========== SKYPE LOGS ==============

[8/8/2013 8:15:44 PM] hunterboerner: I haz idea
[8/8/2013 8:16:08 PM] hunterboerner: this was discussed in #minecraftforge
[8/8/2013 8:16:22 PM] hunterboerner: so you know how ids are currently implemented terribly
[8/8/2013 8:18:12 PM] hunterboerner: and conflicts
[8/8/2013 8:18:24 PM] hunterboerner: well we can't use strings because they take up too much space
[8/8/2013 8:18:37 PM] hunterboerner: (yes they do do the math)
[8/8/2013 8:18:46 PM] hunterboerner: but static ids will be a problem
[8/8/2013 8:19:09 PM] hunterboerner: so we came up with having a file in your world folder that is a conversion between the two
[8/8/2013 8:19:31 PM] hunterboerner: it will have (oreQuantonium: 10)
[8/8/2013 8:19:34 PM] hunterboerner: or something like that
[8/8/2013 8:19:40 PM] hunterboerner: and it gets loaded on the world load
[8/8/2013 8:20:01 PM] hunterboerner: when you add a new mod it gets assigned ids at the end
[8/8/2013 8:20:15 PM] hunterboerner: so you may have different ids for each world
[8/8/2013 8:20:21 PM] hunterboerner: depending on when you added the mod
[8/8/2013 8:20:39 PM] hunterboerner: Whadya think fokas?
[8/8/2013 8:20:53 PM] LordFokas: you need server->client communication
[8/8/2013 8:20:56 PM] LordFokas: because of servers
[8/8/2013 8:20:59 PM] hunterboerner: yes
[8/8/2013 8:21:20 PM] hunterboerner: you can send the data over packets
[8/8/2013 8:21:25 PM] hunterboerner: let me find it real quick
[8/8/2013 8:22:46 PM] hunterboerner: this is how I did it in my old bukkit plugin
[8/8/2013 8:22:46 PM] hunterboerner: https://github.com/hunterboerner/MC-Kill-Count-Bukkit/blob/f2668c1e8c01a4837cd4baf0e8cd7c9c61c97c74/src/me/hunterboerner/killCount/main.java#L56 
[8/8/2013 8:22:57 PM] hunterboerner: I'm pretty sure it's plausible in forge
[8/8/2013 8:33:05 PM] LordFokas: you need to mess with a lot of things
[8/8/2013 8:33:27 PM] LordFokas: that packet MUST arrive before any chunks are sent
[8/8/2013 8:33:40 PM] LordFokas: otherwise shit will happen
[8/8/2013 8:33:58 PM] LordFokas: but yes, we can try it.
[8/8/2013 8:34:20 PM] hunterboerner: the client could deny chunks (or put them on hold) until it receives the file
[8/8/2013 8:35:03 PM] LordFokas: all you need to do is rebuild two arrays
[8/8/2013 8:35:49 PM] LordFokas: actually, it now sounds real simple
[8/8/2013 8:36:12 PM] LordFokas: and because those are ints
[8/8/2013 8:36:24 PM] LordFokas: you can create an array with just the right size
[8/8/2013 8:36:37 PM] LordFokas: no need for 4096 slots when your mod setup uses 300
[8/8/2013 8:37:05 PM] LordFokas: thus reducing memory usage, and block lookup time
[8/8/2013 8:37:07 PM] LordFokas: I like this
[8/8/2013 8:37:12 PM] LordFokas: write it all down :p
[8/8/2013 8:39:55 PM] hunterboerner: how are we going to determine the required size?
[8/8/2013 8:42:36 PM] LordFokas: blocks are loaded into a temporary list
[8/8/2013 8:42:53 PM] LordFokas: like, say, an ArrayList
[8/8/2013 8:43:44 PM] hunterboerner: I'm creating heisenbugmc/ideas
[8/8/2013 8:43:54 PM] LordFokas: DON'T!
[8/8/2013 8:43:57 PM] hunterboerner: why not
[8/8/2013 8:43:59 PM] LordFokas: I hate that
[8/8/2013 8:44:01 PM] hunterboerner: we need somewhere to put it
[8/8/2013 8:44:02 PM] LordFokas: repos are for code
[8/8/2013 8:44:05 PM] LordFokas: not something else
[8/8/2013 8:44:21 PM] hunterboerner: they can also store documentation
[8/8/2013 8:44:25 PM] hunterboerner: which is what this is
[8/8/2013 8:44:35 PM] LordFokas: there's people who have repositories just for the issue tracker to manage their home!
[8/8/2013 8:44:47 PM] hunterboerner: ok so where do we put it
[8/8/2013 8:44:51 PM] LordFokas: I feel like slapping the living shit out of them
[8/8/2013 8:45:00 PM] hunterboerner: ok so where do we put it
[8/8/2013 8:45:03 PM] LordFokas: we have a dropbox >.>
[8/8/2013 8:45:09 PM] hunterboerner: I want it to be public
[8/8/2013 8:45:24 PM] hunterboerner: I'm going to put it in the dropbox
[8/8/2013 8:45:31 PM] hunterboerner: put make a mcforum post too
[8/8/2013 8:45:42 PM] LordFokas: create a repo in the group
[8/8/2013 8:45:50 PM] LordFokas: called HeisenBug
[8/8/2013 8:45:59 PM] LordFokas: everything non-code goes there.
[8/8/2013 8:46:01 PM] hunterboerner: and what do we put there :?
[8/8/2013 8:46:09 PM] hunterboerner: yeah that's what I was thinking....
[8/8/2013 8:46:11 PM] LordFokas: like ideas
[8/8/2013 8:46:13 PM] LordFokas: and shit
[8/8/2013 8:46:31 PM] hunterboerner: so HeisenBugMC/HeisenBugMC
[8/8/2013 8:46:48 PM] LordFokas: I hate the MC part so much >.>
[8/8/2013 8:46:52 PM] LordFokas: but meh
[8/8/2013 8:46:56 PM] LordFokas: whatever
[8/8/2013 9:02:38 PM] hunterboerner: what should we call this?
[8/8/2013 9:03:57 PM] LordFokas: the ID thing?
[8/8/2013 9:04:54 PM] LordFokas: i'd call it OmegaID
[8/8/2013 9:05:02 PM] LordFokas: because it's the end :D
[8/8/2013 9:05:11 PM] LordFokas: but it's more of a Forge PR than a mod
[8/8/2013 9:05:19 PM] LordFokas: unless you make it a Jar Mod
==============================================================================
[8/8/13 10:21:35 PM] LordFokas: you don't need to replace ID's with strings
[8/8/13 10:21:48 PM] LordFokas: but you can register blocks with strings only
[8/8/13 10:22:00 PM] LordFokas: and make the engine automagically assign ids
