Jul 12 13:15:06 <hunterb>   IDs are stupid
Jul 12 13:15:08 *   copygirl (~copygirl@p54A42891.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined
Jul 12 13:15:11 <hunterb>   naming is better
Jul 12 13:15:25 <hunterb>   dickSlapper from dickSlapMod
Jul 12 13:15:39 <hunterb>   I mean, who's gonna have the same thing
Jul 12 13:15:42 <hunterb>   from the same mod
Jul 12 13:15:58 <copygirl>  a guy named dickSlapper
Jul 12 13:16:08 <hunterb>   ah
Jul 12 13:16:39 <NoahBeech> Jeez I've been stuck at a logic issue forever now
Jul 12 13:16:55 *   Archemide has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jul 12 13:16:58 <NoahBeech> only one attribute modifier at a time, but removing one removes them all
Jul 12 13:17:10 <ft975> hunterb: Do you have a better way to store large amounts of data? IDs take up 12 bits, names take up 24*number of characters bits
Jul 12 13:17:11 <hunterb>   keep a list of ones
Jul 12 13:17:27 *   iPixeli (iPixeli@us.freeBNC.net) has joined
Jul 12 13:17:28 <NoahBeech> hunter doesn't work like that
Jul 12 13:17:28 *   MineBot gives voice to iPixeli
Jul 12 13:17:29 <hunterb>   you and your bits
Jul 12 13:17:35 <hunterb>   keep a list of current ones
Jul 12 13:17:39 <hunterb>   and when you need to remove one
Jul 12 13:17:43 <hunterb>   remove them all
Jul 12 13:17:47 <hunterb>   and apply the rest back
Jul 12 13:18:03 <ntzrmtthihu777>    fucking sweet :D
Jul 12 13:18:04 *   Wylker is now known as Wylker|work
Jul 12 13:18:10 <hunterb>   ft975: does it really matter how many bits you take up
Jul 12 13:18:14 <ft975> Yes
Jul 12 13:18:21 <hunterb>   why
Jul 12 13:18:22 *   SoundLogic (~SoundLogi@static-63-131-38-87.mil.onecommunications.net) has joined
Jul 12 13:18:23 <ft975> Ram and HD space is not unlimted
Jul 12 13:18:27 <hunterb>   -_-
Jul 12 13:18:36 <hunterb>   you're concerned about BITS
Jul 12 13:18:38 <ntzrmtthihu777>    or swap, for that matter :P
Jul 12 13:18:58 *   Fiery-Zzz is now known as Fiery-phone
Jul 12 13:19:08 <AbrarSyed> you know what i rally hate?
Jul 12 13:19:12 <hunterb>   me
Jul 12 13:19:16 <AbrarSyed> thinking something is working perfectly after testing
Jul 12 13:19:26 *   HanFox is now known as HanFox|gone
Jul 12 13:19:37 <AbrarSyed> and then finding out later that another task isnt workign ebcause what you that was working is actually broken
Jul 12 13:19:44 <AbrarSyed> and then having to go back and fix it...
Jul 12 13:19:52 <AbrarSyed> so freaking annoying....
Jul 12 13:19:52 <ntzrmtthihu777>    now, one question, this server world, it will remain the same each login?
Jul 12 13:19:53 <ft975> For a 200x200x200 world, names would take up approximately 1.4GB of space
Jul 12 13:20:18 <hunterb>   well how bout the mods write names
Jul 12 13:20:23 <hunterb>   and then the game converts the names to id
Jul 12 13:20:34 <AbrarSyed> now a real nice way of saving would be to use IDs, but then have an ID-> name map somewhere
Jul 12 13:20:39 <hunterb>   so the ids are handles by mc
Jul 12 13:20:48 <AbrarSyed> mhmm
Jul 12 13:21:14 <hunterb>   so the game keeps a list of names to ids itself
Jul 12 13:21:25 <hunterb>   and it syncs with other clients when they join the world
Jul 12 13:21:37 <hunterb>   each time a new block is added, it gets a larger id
Jul 12 13:21:58 <hunterb>   so that each world in itself has its own set of name to id map
Jul 12 13:22:02 <ft975> hunterb: That would work, and the game already does it, sort of. Forge saves all the IDs with the map so it can warn you not to ruin your world.
Jul 12 13:22:18 <hunterb>   not the server though :P
Jul 12 13:22:21 <AbrarSyed> well
Jul 12 13:22:34 <tehbeard>  hmm, can you access that from the api ft?
Jul 12 13:22:34 <AbrarSyed> I was thinking to use that in a type of schematic format
Jul 12 13:22:45 <AbrarSyed> so it can be used cross-game without the exact same configuration
Jul 12 13:22:56 <AbrarSyed> blocks will have IDs specific to the schematic file
Jul 12 13:23:01 <tehbeard>  abrar, you said exactly the problem i'm currently working on
Jul 12 13:23:02 *   fuj1n has quit (Ping timeout: 194 seconds)
Jul 12 13:23:10 <hunterb>   :P
Jul 12 13:23:10 <ft975> tehbeard:  I'm not sure, I've only seen the system from the user's side, not the code
Jul 12 13:23:18 <AbrarSyed> and then the game will read that matching the name and convert IDs
Jul 12 13:23:31 *   AbrarSyed highfives tehbeard 
Jul 12 13:23:52 *   Archemide (~Archemide@67.41.75.62) has joined
Jul 12 13:24:00 <w00tc0d3>  how can I use the forge server installer for 1.5.2?
Jul 12 13:24:10 <hunterb>   ids just don't work on a large scale like mc
Jul 12 13:24:20 <hunterb>   because it gets complicated wiht conflicts
Jul 12 13:25:22 <AbrarSyed> hunterb, if you know anything about efficiency, saving a string for every location instead of a number will cause infinite lag
Jul 12 13:25:40 <hunterb>   yes but having to manually set each id is a terrible idea
Jul 12 13:25:58 <hunterb>   so at least something that bridges the two
Jul 12 13:26:06 <hunterb>   write with names, run with ids
Jul 12 13:26:20 <AbrarSyed> well.. Minecraft wasnt made to be modded.
Jul 12 13:26:33 <Flenix>    Only just tuning in here so not exactly sure what you're talking about,
Jul 12 13:26:46 <Flenix>    but I've always thought Forge should implement some sort of way that ID's are set with the modID
Jul 12 13:26:46 <hunterb>   we're talking about ids having conflicts
Jul 12 13:26:52 <Flenix>    for example myAwesomeMod.4
Jul 12 13:26:59 <AbrarSyed> npe, won't work.
Jul 12 13:27:02 <AbrarSyed> *won't
Jul 12 13:27:13 <AbrarSyed> it NEEDS to be an ID.. and 1.5 bytes is more than enough
Jul 12 13:27:13 <Archemide> you mean *nope?
Jul 12 13:27:28 *   lKinx (~lKinx@2602:304:cf60:c390:653c:f891:209e:3162) has joined
Jul 12 13:27:30 <AbrarSyed> yes, nope = nullpointerexception dontcha know?
Jul 12 13:27:34 <AbrarSyed> :P
Jul 12 13:27:37 <Flenix>    1.5 bytes; is that the 4096 ID limit?
Jul 12 13:27:38 <Archemide> :P
Jul 12 13:27:43 <AbrarSyed> Flenix,  yes.
Jul 12 13:27:46 <AbrarSyed> 256 = 1 byte
Jul 12 13:27:49 <Flenix>    I'd argue that's not enough at all personally, as someone who loves as much content as possible :P
Jul 12 13:27:54 <hunterb>   that doesn't sound like enough
Jul 12 13:27:59 <AbrarSyed> now think about it this way
Jul 12 13:28:07 <AbrarSyed> EVERY block in the world has to have an ID
Jul 12 13:28:11 <hunterb>   eww thinking
Jul 12 13:28:19 *   Renari (~Renari_@bngr-74-212-29-226-pppoe.dsl.bngr.epix.net) has joined
Jul 12 13:28:20 <AbrarSyed> so how many numbers is 1 17x16x256 chunk?
Jul 12 13:28:26 <AbrarSyed> *16x16x256
Jul 12 13:28:29 <Archemide> touche
Jul 12 13:28:32 <sci4me>    Hey guys, so.. you know how people build computers and things in redstone and they're ridiculously slow... well, could it be possible to make them a TON faster by making redstone faster? ive looked into the redstone code but im not really sure how it could be made faster...
Jul 12 13:28:41 <Flenix>    65536 :P
Jul 12 13:28:44 <AbrarSyed> if you had that manys trings.... minecraft would never laod or render anything
Jul 12 13:28:48 <AbrarSyed> *strings
Jul 12 13:28:51 <AbrarSyed> so it MUST be IDs
Jul 12 13:28:56 <Flenix>    Valid point
Jul 12 13:29:09 <AbrarSyed> and the limit of IDs, is directy related to the ammount of memory it needs to un
Jul 12 13:29:10 <Archemide> hmm. is there any way forge could up the cap?
Jul 12 13:29:18 <ft975>  I recently learned of Huffman Encoding, It might be useful in things like IDs, the size would be dependent on the number of blocks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
Jul 12 13:29:35 <AbrarSyed> 1.5 bytes is actually a really good amount because metadata in minecraft is exactly .5 bytes
Jul 12 13:29:39 <ft975> AbrarSyed: My calculations said 1.5GB as strings
Jul 12 13:29:43 <AbrarSyed> so 2bytes per block, and then whatever needs a TE
Jul 12 13:29:58 <AbrarSyed> lets say... 20 char strings
Jul 12 13:30:07 <ft975> assuming an 8 character average
Jul 12 13:30:13 <AbrarSyed> char = 2 bytes = 40 bytes per block
Jul 12 13:30:18 <AbrarSyed> who can fit a modid into 8 characters?
Jul 12 13:30:34 <hunterb>   don't facades stuff a crap ton of stuff into them?
Jul 12 13:30:41 <Archemide> aren't most modid's short?
Jul 12 13:30:44 <Flenix>    I bet all modders could change their ID's to 8 chars if thye wanted to
Jul 12 13:30:45 <AbrarSyed> facade = TileEntity
Jul 12 13:30:54 <AbrarSyed> now tile entities are different..
Jul 12 13:30:56 <Flenix>    My longest one is "FlenixCities", I could easily do flnxcity
Jul 12 13:31:02 <AbrarSyed> Flenix, thatd be a nightmare to fix conflicts with
Jul 12 13:31:24 <ft975> ftblock, ftdirt, ftlol, ftusles
Jul 12 13:31:30 <AbrarSyed> if we allow all unicode chars
Jul 12 13:31:43 <hunterb>   who wants to bug Mojang to do this next
Jul 12 13:31:52 *   AbrarSyed rolls eyes
Jul 12 13:31:53 <AbrarSyed> anyways
Jul 12 13:31:59 <AbrarSyed> it MUST BE INTEGER IDS
Jul 12 13:32:03 <sci4me>    ^^
Jul 12 13:32:05 <AbrarSyed> wel.. 1.5 byte ids
Jul 12 13:32:11 <Flenix>    Alright, what about a new form of meta. Forge looks at the IDs, and assigns it to a unique number set on the server/client (and editable in the config). Then, the ID's are loaded like ModID.BlockID (for example 3.564)
Jul 12 13:32:12 <AbrarSyed> integer = 4 bytes.. too much
Jul 12 13:32:18 <Flenix>    oh, no doubles?
Jul 12 13:32:21 <hunterb>   but the game can control the mapping of ids
Jul 12 13:32:24 <Flenix>    There goes my idea :P
Jul 12 13:32:29 <AbrarSyed> doubles are like 8 or something....
Jul 12 13:32:32 <ft975> Flenix: Doubles are 64 bits
Jul 12 13:32:37 <AbrarSyed> now what im thinking of is tis.
Jul 12 13:32:42 <hunterb>   shorts?
Jul 12 13:32:45 <AbrarSyed> I actually had cpw add this in to FML for me too
Jul 12 13:32:50 <AbrarSyed> there is the gameRegistry
Jul 12 13:32:52 <ft975> And they aren't fixed point
Jul 12 13:33:04 <ft975>  hunterb: Shorts are way too big
Jul 12 13:33:05 <AbrarSyed> which reisters every block, its ID, and its mod, as well as unlocalized name if you provide one
Jul 12 13:33:08 <hunterb>   bytes
Jul 12 13:33:17 <ft975> 2 bytes
Jul 12 13:33:21 <AbrarSyed> with thsi we effctively have a mod-name-id map to use
Jul 12 13:33:24 <ft975> 64: unsigned
Jul 12 13:33:42 <ft975> s/64:/64k
Jul 12 13:33:42 <OverbotDL1>    > ft975: 64k unsigned
Jul 12 13:34:19 <Flenix>    How would that map be useful though? :P
Jul 12 13:34:25 <AbrarSyed> when saving or loading a world, Minecraft would not lose any data due to different IDs because it can match by name from the file
Jul 12 13:34:34 <AbrarSyed> and then simply grab the ID for the name, and use that in the game
Jul 12 13:34:36 <hunterb>   didn't I mention that
Jul 12 13:34:50 <AbrarSyed> it would also fix IDconflicts, because Minecraft could just assign out IDs as blocks are registerred
Jul 12 13:35:01 <AbrarSyed> different ID configurations would be handled as I said above
Jul 12 13:35:07 <ft975> So who's going to make the pull request?
Jul 12 13:35:12 <hunterb>   hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:13 <hunterb>   so the game keeps a list of names to ids itself
Jul 12 13:35:14 <hunterb>   [1:21pm] <hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:16 <hunterb>   and it syncs with other clients when they join the world
Jul 12 13:35:17 <hunterb>   [1:21pm] <hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:18 <hunterb>   each time a new block is added, it gets a larger id
Jul 12 13:35:19 <hunterb>   [1:21pm] <hunterb>
Jul 12 13:35:20 <hunterb>   so that each world in itself has its own set of name to id map
Jul 12 13:35:22 <AbrarSyed> right now, Minecraft MUST have the same IDs laod to load, otherwise you end up with transforming blocks and missing stuff
Jul 12 13:35:23 <Flenix>    That's a cool idea. But, I'm one of those guys that likes my stuff in creative in a certain order (or when sorting inventory with InvTweaks)
Jul 12 13:35:50 <AbrarSyed> yes hunter, you said that after I introduced the name-id map idea
Jul 12 13:35:53 <hunterb>   back to build.xmling

[22:09:56] <hunterboerner> my team (HeisenBug) are planning a big PR for forge
[22:09:58] <GrygrFlzr> FC?
[22:10:07] <hunterboerner> flowerchild
[22:10:11] <GrygrFlzr> ah
[22:10:13] <GrygrFlzr> :/
[22:10:25] <hunterboerner> this is the plan https://github.com/HeisenBugMC/HeisenBugMC/blob/master/ideas/OmegaID.md
[22:10:32] <hunterboerner> AbrarSyed should remember that
[22:10:33] <GrygrFlzr> Welp, time to test forge compatibility on his mod (likely not compatible, oh well)
[22:10:37] <hunterboerner> we have it in the log folder
[22:10:54] <luacs1998> GrygrFlzr, base modding is effectively banned with the new launcher
[22:11:00] <GrygrFlzr> ikr
[22:11:01] <luacs1998> its doable, but a pita
[22:11:13] <GrygrFlzr> Yeah, and he didn't even put on proper instructions
[22:11:19] <hunterboerner> but we've got cpw that takes care of it all
[22:11:22] <GrygrFlzr> "place files into minecraft.jar"
[22:11:27] <GrygrFlzr> :/
[22:11:54] <luacs1998> hunterboerner, don't pull it to forge, approach mojang with the idea
[22:11:57] <GrygrFlzr> methinks I need to make an instruction page on the modlist, at least for forge
[22:12:00] <Morgrimm> mother fucker. I need to update forge >.<
[22:12:11] <Morgrimm> how hard is it to update forge with the pahi setup?
[22:12:16] <luacs1998> not sure
[22:12:18] <hunterboerner> what is the credibality of luacs1998?

[22:15:30] <luacs1998> i think LM would be asking the same questions
[22:15:39] <luacs1998> now thats a rather callous attitude
[22:15:52] <hunterboerner> you're the one not using the fancy new system :P
[22:16:13] <luacs1998> i'm taking my old world, and i'm putting it into the new system.
[22:16:22] <luacs1998> will my world go bad?
[22:16:30] <hunterboerner> it could ask you if you would like to convert it to the new system or not
[22:16:46] <luacs1998> and if i dont?
[22:17:00] <hunterboerner> then youre just using the old vanilla system
[22:17:00] <GrygrFlzr> So once it's been tainted with OmegaID you can't even load it in vanilla
[22:17:13] <GrygrFlzr> :/
[22:17:19] *** Joins: steffengy (~quassel@p5088FA45.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[22:17:41] <hunterboerner> GrygrFlzr: if it's been taited with OmegaID then it's assumed you're using mods that add blocks (if you're not using mods it doesn't need to be enabled)
[22:17:49] <luacs1998> hunterboerner, say, i take a ftb unleashed world, and i bring it to a omegaID game with the exact same mods
[22:17:56] <luacs1998> will things go bad?
[22:18:05] <hunterboerner> no
[22:18:34] <hunterboerner> because it would detect that there is no name to id file there
[22:18:38] <GrygrFlzr> hunterboerner: with the current mod system if you load it in vanilla it will still work, just removing the modded blocks from existence, there's still a graceful degradation
[22:18:44] <luacs1998> so i can take worlds in and out of omegaID with no problems?
[22:18:56] <GrygrFlzr> With the omegaID system you're basically making a new world format
[22:19:10] <luacs1998> (which is why i said, take it to mojang)
[22:19:10] <hunterboerner> luacs1998: vanilla block ids will always be in the same order (that would be a forced thing)
[22:19:19] <luacs1998> send jeb an email or something
[22:19:42] <luacs1998> how about supporting future minecraft versions?
[22:19:46] <ASB2> Really doubts jeb would respond
[22:19:47] <GrygrFlzr> ^
[22:19:51] <GrygrFlzr> * ^^
[22:19:53] <hunterboerner> ^^^^
[22:20:14] <GrygrFlzr> Seriously, if you're not gonna even bother trying, don't complain
[22:20:38] <hunterboerner> luacs1998: new block added in vanilla we have two options for implementing this
[22:20:42] *** cpw|out is now known as cpw
[22:20:48] <hunterboerner> either allocate a bunch of space for vanilla block and items
[22:21:09] <hunterboerner> or have it take a while and shift all the mod ids down the list and add the vanilla one in
[22:21:25] <hunterboerner> the second one would be more long term but slower when updating a world
[22:21:35] <GrygrFlzr> ._.
[22:21:38] <luacs1998> and also, because i'm sure there's a lot of people using worldedit and mcedit
[22:21:42] <GrygrFlzr> ^
[22:21:51] <luacs1998> how is omegaid going to affect them?
[22:22:23] <GrygrFlzr> And you can't just force those people to support your new-modded-world-format either
[22:22:28] <luacs1998> especially mcedit, thats a bigger problem
[22:22:55] <hunterboerner> world edit looks at ids (the name to id system would have to be reworked because it is just a csv file (don't quote me on that)) and you can access an id
[22:23:09] <hunterboerner> but you can't assume it to be a certain block
[22:23:14] <hunterboerner> because the ids are changing
[22:23:21] *** Quits: steffengy_ (~quassel@p5088F07C.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 380 seconds)
[22:23:23] <luacs1998> and mcedit?
[22:23:26] <hunterboerner> so worldedit would have to look at the unlocalizedname
[22:23:27] <GrygrFlzr> Practically no compatibility, then
[22:23:39] <GrygrFlzr> hunterboerner, you need to take a look at the bigger picture
[22:23:55] <GrygrFlzr> Not just at how forge would handle your changes
[22:23:56] *** Quits: LordFokas (~LordFokas@bl22-62-198.dsl.telepac.pt) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:23:59] *** Quits: Gilded_Knight (~Gilded_Kn@pool-71-251-212-2.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:24:49] <luacs1998> also, i doubt cp.w and LM would accept PRs for changing the world format, which is what you come across as wanting to do
[22:24:51] <hunterboerner> the bigger picture is you don't touch vanilla for compat between forge worlds and non forge clients
[22:25:04] <luacs1998> but? external tools can go to hell?
[22:25:17] *** Quits: Cojosan (~Brojosan@86.sub-70-210-6.myvzw.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:25:28] <hunterboerner> no world edit would just have to look at unlocalized names
[22:25:37] <GrygrFlzr> ...
[22:25:37] <hunterboerner> at least for mod blocks
[22:25:43] <luacs1998> if you're gonna do such a big change i recommend you release as a standalone mod first
[22:25:49] <luacs1998> MCEDIT, MCEDIT
[22:25:58] <luacs1998> which is a different beast altogether
[22:26:01] <hunterboerner> because already if you're going to modify a mod block with mc edit it depends on your configs
[22:26:11] <GrygrFlzr> I really very much doubt the PR will be accepted
[22:26:15] <luacs1998> so? how would users configure it?
[22:26:22] <GrygrFlzr> hunterboerner, graceful degradation
[22:26:41] <luacs1998> GrygrFlzr, LM will say it's absolute bull shit and rage at everything
[22:26:48] <GrygrFlzr> luacs1998, I agree
[22:26:49] <hunterboerner> either we have them look at the name - id file or we present an interface in one of the menus in game
[22:27:02] <hunterboerner> luacs1998: LM seems to do that a lot
[22:27:19] *** Quits: JohSketch (~JohSketch@c-66-177-104-168.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) (Quit: Leaving...)
[22:27:28] <GrygrFlzr> Basically, you are making a new world format/
[22:27:33] <luacs1998> thats thw whole point, only QUALITY work, with a proper and valid USE CASE, he accepts
[22:27:51] *** duke605|Work is now known as duke605
[22:27:55] <luacs1998> and i doubt LM would accept PRs for a new world format in forge
[22:27:55] <hunterboerner> no not a new format just a new interface to the existing format
[22:28:02] <GrygrFlzr> No, you're not
[22:28:06] <luacs1998> it comes across as a new format
[22:28:18] <GrygrFlzr> You said it yourself, it requires conversion
[22:28:18] <luacs1998> the id-block mapping file is already major enough
[22:28:18] <hunterboerner> re-assigning ids automatically is not a new format
[22:28:25] <GrygrFlzr> That's a new world format
[22:28:30] <luacs1998> idresolver does it, and does it well
[22:28:33] <GrygrFlzr> ^
[22:28:41] <luacs1998> i dont see where your mod comes in to do it better
[22:29:30] <luacs1998> and also, it would require big time fucking up of mc internals
[22:29:49] <luacs1998> when blocks and items are registered, they are registered with an ID
[22:29:57] <luacs1998> you'd have to rewrite that
[22:30:24] <hunterboerner> the plan is to ignore the ids and just use the unlocalizedname assign an id for that automatically and write it to a config file
[22:30:25] <luacs1998> its very invasive, and LM won't do it
[22:30:40] *** Quits: ShamblerDK (~quassel@37.75.163.130) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:31:00] <hunterboerner> you do realize Mojang changes stuff dramatically ever few updates
[22:31:05] <luacs1998> two things: either release as standalone mod (give people a choice) or apporach mojang with the idea (they dont listen)
[22:31:20] <luacs1998> they can do it, because they write minecraf
[22:31:20] <GrygrFlzr> hunterboerner, the point is, you are not Mojang
[22:31:39] <luacs1998> if you know the concept of headcrabs, then forge is like a headcrab on mojang
[22:31:47] <hunterboerner> the reason I wanted to do a PR is because it modifys so much base classes
[22:31:58] <luacs1998> optifine mods many base classes
[22:32:16] <luacs1998> i know many mods that still stay in the jar
[22:32:41] <luacs1998> if you really want this in forge, then make your base edits more generic

=========== SKYPE LOGS ==============

[8/8/2013 8:15:44 PM] hunterboerner: I haz idea
[8/8/2013 8:16:08 PM] hunterboerner: this was discussed in #minecraftforge
[8/8/2013 8:16:22 PM] hunterboerner: so you know how ids are currently implemented terribly
[8/8/2013 8:18:12 PM] hunterboerner: and conflicts
[8/8/2013 8:18:24 PM] hunterboerner: well we can't use strings because they take up too much space
[8/8/2013 8:18:37 PM] hunterboerner: (yes they do do the math)
[8/8/2013 8:18:46 PM] hunterboerner: but static ids will be a problem
[8/8/2013 8:19:09 PM] hunterboerner: so we came up with having a file in your world folder that is a conversion between the two
[8/8/2013 8:19:31 PM] hunterboerner: it will have (oreQuantonium: 10)
[8/8/2013 8:19:34 PM] hunterboerner: or something like that
[8/8/2013 8:19:40 PM] hunterboerner: and it gets loaded on the world load
[8/8/2013 8:20:01 PM] hunterboerner: when you add a new mod it gets assigned ids at the end
[8/8/2013 8:20:15 PM] hunterboerner: so you may have different ids for each world
[8/8/2013 8:20:21 PM] hunterboerner: depending on when you added the mod
[8/8/2013 8:20:39 PM] hunterboerner: Whadya think fokas?
[8/8/2013 8:20:53 PM] LordFokas: you need server->client communication
[8/8/2013 8:20:56 PM] LordFokas: because of servers
[8/8/2013 8:20:59 PM] hunterboerner: yes
[8/8/2013 8:21:20 PM] hunterboerner: you can send the data over packets
[8/8/2013 8:21:25 PM] hunterboerner: let me find it real quick
[8/8/2013 8:22:46 PM] hunterboerner: this is how I did it in my old bukkit plugin
[8/8/2013 8:22:46 PM] hunterboerner: https://github.com/hunterboerner/MC-Kill-Count-Bukkit/blob/f2668c1e8c01a4837cd4baf0e8cd7c9c61c97c74/src/me/hunterboerner/killCount/main.java#L56 
[8/8/2013 8:22:57 PM] hunterboerner: I'm pretty sure it's plausible in forge
[8/8/2013 8:33:05 PM] LordFokas: you need to mess with a lot of things
[8/8/2013 8:33:27 PM] LordFokas: that packet MUST arrive before any chunks are sent
[8/8/2013 8:33:40 PM] LordFokas: otherwise shit will happen
[8/8/2013 8:33:58 PM] LordFokas: but yes, we can try it.
[8/8/2013 8:34:20 PM] hunterboerner: the client could deny chunks (or put them on hold) until it receives the file
[8/8/2013 8:35:03 PM] LordFokas: all you need to do is rebuild two arrays
[8/8/2013 8:35:49 PM] LordFokas: actually, it now sounds real simple
[8/8/2013 8:36:12 PM] LordFokas: and because those are ints
[8/8/2013 8:36:24 PM] LordFokas: you can create an array with just the right size
[8/8/2013 8:36:37 PM] LordFokas: no need for 4096 slots when your mod setup uses 300
[8/8/2013 8:37:05 PM] LordFokas: thus reducing memory usage, and block lookup time
[8/8/2013 8:37:07 PM] LordFokas: I like this
[8/8/2013 8:37:12 PM] LordFokas: write it all down :p
[8/8/2013 8:39:55 PM] hunterboerner: how are we going to determine the required size?
[8/8/2013 8:42:36 PM] LordFokas: blocks are loaded into a temporary list
[8/8/2013 8:42:53 PM] LordFokas: like, say, an ArrayList
[8/8/2013 8:43:44 PM] hunterboerner: I'm creating heisenbugmc/ideas
[8/8/2013 8:43:54 PM] LordFokas: DON'T!
[8/8/2013 8:43:57 PM] hunterboerner: why not
[8/8/2013 8:43:59 PM] LordFokas: I hate that
[8/8/2013 8:44:01 PM] hunterboerner: we need somewhere to put it
[8/8/2013 8:44:02 PM] LordFokas: repos are for code
[8/8/2013 8:44:05 PM] LordFokas: not something else
[8/8/2013 8:44:21 PM] hunterboerner: they can also store documentation
[8/8/2013 8:44:25 PM] hunterboerner: which is what this is
[8/8/2013 8:44:35 PM] LordFokas: there's people who have repositories just for the issue tracker to manage their home!
[8/8/2013 8:44:47 PM] hunterboerner: ok so where do we put it
[8/8/2013 8:44:51 PM] LordFokas: I feel like slapping the living shit out of them
[8/8/2013 8:45:00 PM] hunterboerner: ok so where do we put it
[8/8/2013 8:45:03 PM] LordFokas: we have a dropbox >.>
[8/8/2013 8:45:09 PM] hunterboerner: I want it to be public
[8/8/2013 8:45:24 PM] hunterboerner: I'm going to put it in the dropbox
[8/8/2013 8:45:31 PM] hunterboerner: put make a mcforum post too
[8/8/2013 8:45:42 PM] LordFokas: create a repo in the group
[8/8/2013 8:45:50 PM] LordFokas: called HeisenBug
[8/8/2013 8:45:59 PM] LordFokas: everything non-code goes there.
[8/8/2013 8:46:01 PM] hunterboerner: and what do we put there :?
[8/8/2013 8:46:09 PM] hunterboerner: yeah that's what I was thinking....
[8/8/2013 8:46:11 PM] LordFokas: like ideas
[8/8/2013 8:46:13 PM] LordFokas: and shit
[8/8/2013 8:46:31 PM] hunterboerner: so HeisenBugMC/HeisenBugMC
[8/8/2013 8:46:48 PM] LordFokas: I hate the MC part so much >.>
[8/8/2013 8:46:52 PM] LordFokas: but meh
[8/8/2013 8:46:56 PM] LordFokas: whatever
[8/8/2013 9:02:38 PM] hunterboerner: what should we call this?
[8/8/2013 9:03:57 PM] LordFokas: the ID thing?
[8/8/2013 9:04:54 PM] LordFokas: i'd call it OmegaID
[8/8/2013 9:05:02 PM] LordFokas: because it's the end :D
[8/8/2013 9:05:11 PM] LordFokas: but it's more of a Forge PR than a mod
[8/8/2013 9:05:19 PM] LordFokas: unless you make it a Jar Mod
==============================================================================
[8/8/13 10:21:35 PM] LordFokas: you don't need to replace ID's with strings
[8/8/13 10:21:48 PM] LordFokas: but you can register blocks with strings only
[8/8/13 10:22:00 PM] LordFokas: and make the engine automagically assign ids
